# EFNet: Attention based CNN-LSTM Networks for Energy Usage Forecasting with External Factors


## Abstract


Recently, deep learning methods have been used to predict energy usage. It is important to use appropriate factors for the accuracy of the prediction. Factors that affect energy usage include not only weather, date factors but also social and economic factors. Social and economic factors are expected to affect energy usage significantly due to the recent COVID-19 trend. We propose EFNet(Energy usage Forecasting Network) which forecast energy usage by using attention based CNN-LSTM networks. EFNet is a sequential prediction model that reflects the characteristics of variables such as weather, calendar, oil price, and COVID-19 confirmed cases. We conduct experiments on the real-world data in South Korea and we demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively predict the energy usage and significantly outperform other baseline models. Furthermore, since the model reflecting the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases have higher predictive power than the model that do not, external variables such as COVID-19 can be seen as important factors in predicting energy usage.
